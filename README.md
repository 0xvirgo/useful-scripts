# Useful Scripts
A collection of useful Python scripts that I used in the VeChain blockchain.

- `bulk-transfer.py`

  This script transfers nfts from a single wallet to a list of wallet addresses. A single transaction transfers 100 nfts.
- `create-token-metadata-list.py`

  This script creates a csv file from ERC721 token metadata in json files.
- `generate-wallets.py`

  This script generates wallet addresses based on the specified amount.
